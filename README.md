**How to interact with the work**

A key: add a pattern. If the position does not fit, the pattern will be automatically reduced.

D key: reduce a random pattern.

S key: refresh the page to make the pattern appear in a random position.

Space bar: hold down the space bar, and all patterns will start to rotate counterclockwise.

Left mouse button: stop the cursor on the pattern, hold down the left button to drag the icon.

**Details of my individual code**

I use the keyboard and mouse to drive my code to make it more vivid and interesting. At the beginning of our teamwork, I learned that the author Pacita Abad's work "The Wheel of Life" is inspired by her diverse life experiences and cultural background. In my personal understanding, I think it is more like a struggle against fate, showing people's rough life through colorful colors and uneven surfaces. So in my code, users can add or delete patterns at will, and even drag them. After building your own wheel of fortune, hold down the space bar to make it spin.
