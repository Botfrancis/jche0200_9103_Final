### How to interact with the work

A key: add a pattern. If the position does not fit, the pattern will be automatically reduced.

D key: reduce a random pattern.

S key: refresh the page to make the pattern appear in a random position.

Space bar: hold down the space bar, and all patterns will start to rotate counterclockwise.

Left mouse button: stop the cursor on the pattern, hold down the left button to drag the icon.

### Details of my individual code

In my code, I use the keyboard and mouse to add dynamic interaction, making it more engaging and lively for users. At the beginning of our teamwork, I learned that Pacita Abad's work *The Wheel of Life* is deeply inspired by her diverse life experiences and cultural background. To me, the piece feels like a representation of humanity's struggle against fate, where vibrant colors and textured surfaces symbolize the challenges and roughness of life.

To capture this essence, my code allows users to freely add or remove patterns and even drag them around the canvas, creating their own unique "Wheel of Fortune." Once they’ve designed their wheel, they can hold down the space bar to set it spinning, bringing the project to life and adding a sense of movement that echoes the cyclical nature of life’s journey.
